# pandsproject

this is the project for the pands module in ATU. 

the main libary used will be as followed 

matplotlib
seaborn
pandas 
numpy 


in this project we will be researching the iris data set. this data set was introduced in 1936 by R.A. Fisher A British statistician and biologist in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". this data set is available from The UCI Machine Learning Repository. The UCI Machine Learning Repository states "the Iris dataset is widely used in pattern recognition learning. One class is linearly separable from the other two classes, which are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute of the data set is the class of Iris plant to which each observation belongs".

this dataset is a multivariate dataset and consists of 150 instances that has five attributes, four of these attributes are related to the measurements of sepal and of petals, it includes 50 plants each of three classes of Iris plant, where each class is a different type or species of Iris plant. The three classes in the data set are the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolor and the Iris Virginica.
